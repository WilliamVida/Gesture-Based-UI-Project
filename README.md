# Gesture Based UI Project
Author: William Vida <br>
Lecturer: Damien Costello

## Description
This repository contains an endless 2D platformer developed using Unity 2020.1.10f1 as part of my final year module Gesture Based URI Development. The game primarily uses the mouse and keyboard but voice commands can also be used for certain game mechanics. Click on [Gesture Based UI Project.pdf](Gesture%20Based%20UI%20Project.pdf) to view the project brief.
